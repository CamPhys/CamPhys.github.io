# N-body Simulation

This was a 6 week long coding project for a 10 credit 'Scientific Computing' module. This was produced to model the dynamics of any N-body system.

## Test Case
To validate that the dynamics are correctly calculated the Barru's problem was used as a test case.

## Chaos Analysis
The primary area of this project was invesigating the chaotic nature of exoplanets and gravitationaly systems. This was primarily done through the use of Lyatnov exponents.
